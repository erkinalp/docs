To quote Discord's reference documentation : [The API] is based around two core layers, a HTTPS/REST API for general operations, and persistent secure WebSocket based connection for sending and subscribing to real-time events. Base URL \ud83d\udd17 https://www.guilded.gg/api Error Messages \ud83d\udd17 Your typical error message should look like this: { \"code\" : \"YouDidBadError\" , \"message\" : \"you did bad. here is how you did bad. do better.\" } ... along with an appropriate HTTP status code . Authentication \ud83d\udd17 As mentioned in the Intro page , there is no bot API. In order to automate an application on the API, you would have to use a user account. For the HTTP API, authentication is not passed through the headers, but the JSON body. Quick Authentication How-To \ud83d\udd17 POST /login Logs you into Guilded. Important data here is the returned guilded_mid cookie, which you need to pass as a guildedClientId query argument when connecting to the gateway . JSON Parameters \ud83d\udd17 Field Type Description Required email string the account's email true password string the account's password true Encryption \ud83d\udd17 The REST and WebSocket APIs are 'secure' (HTTPS, WSS). I am unsure of any other steps Guilded takes to secure data, if any. Snowflakes & UUIDs \ud83d\udd17 Unlike Discord, Guilded uses UUIDs for many of its unique IDs ( Channels (all types), Messages , and Webhooks use UUIDs). Because of this, none of the same properties apply as to Snowflakes. Generating UUIDs \ud83d\udd17 For some endpoints, you will have to Bring Your Own UUID (BYOU). Worry not - this is typically a trivial task. Most languages should come with a way to generate a compliant UUID with ease, or have a 3rd-party library for such a purpose: Method Language uuid.uuid1() Python uuid.uuidv4() JavaScript uuid-random.uuid() JavaScript System.Guid.NewGuid() C# Uuid::new_v4() Rust UUID.random Crystal UUID.randomUUID() Java Generic Object IDs \ud83d\udd17 These are 8-character, probably-meaningless IDs that Guilded uses in lieu of Snowflakes or UUIDs. They are used for objects like Teams , Groups , and Users . ISO8601 Date/Time \ud83d\udd17 Guilded utilizes the ISO8601 format for most Date/Times returned. This format is referred to as type ISO8601 timestamp within tables in this documentation. Nullable and Optional Resource Fields \ud83d\udd17 Resource fields that may contain a null value have types that are prefixed with a question mark. Resource fields that are optional have names that are suffixed with a question mark. Example Nullable and Optional Fields \ud83d\udd17 Field Type optional_field? string nullable_field ?string optional_and_nullable_field? ?string HTTP API \ud83d\udd17 Rate Limiting \ud83d\udd17 The HTTP API has very loose rate limits, most likely due to it not being written for automation. Because of this, we do not know much about how rate limiting works on Guilded. A good rule of thumb is to not spam the API with repetitive requests and to simply stay reasonable. Gateway (WebSocket) API \ud83d\udd17 The Gateway API is used for maintaining persistent, stateful websocket connections between your client and Guilded servers. These connections are used for receiving real-time events your client can use to track and update local state. For information on opening Gateway connections, please see the Gateway API section. Message Formatting \ud83d\udd17 Guilded uses markdown for writing messages in clients. Message are returned via the API in a very 'stacked' format. Each aspect of a message's content, such as text formatting, a mention, or anything else, is provided in a different leaf of the current node. Fortunately, this is not a format you have to send ; you can instead use pure markdown by providing markdown-plain-text as your type . todo: fact check above Image Formatting \ud83d\udd17 Image Base URLs \ud83d\udd17 https://img.guildedcdn.com/ https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www.guilded.gg/ Guilded uses hashes for its images. These hashes are not returned alone in most HTTP API requests, however--instead you are returned a full URL on the Amazon AWS platform. Below are the formats, size limitations, and CDN endpoints for images in Guilded. The returned format can be changed by changing the extension name at the end of the URL. The returned size can be changed by appending a -{Size} to the URL, just before the file extension. See below for available size formats. It is important to note that, while URLs using the CDN domain are shorter than, and serve the same purpose as, AWS URLs, they will not display properly in embeds (in constrast to AWS URLs). Image Formats \ud83d\udd17 Name Extension PNG .png aPNG .png JPEG .jpg, .jpeg WebP .webp GIF .gif CDN Endpoints \ud83d\udd17 Type Path Supports User Avatar UserAvatar/hash.png PNG, GIF Profile Banner UserBanner/hash.png PNG Image in Chat ContentMedia/hash.webp WebP Team Emoji CustomReaction/hash.webp WebP, aPNG Team Icon TeamAvatar/hash.png PNG Team Banner TeamBanner/hash.png PNG Sizes \ud83d\udd17 Your -{Size} can be one of -Small , -Medium , -Large , and sometimes -Hero . Banners can only be Hero , but avatars are never Hero . Example CDN URL \ud83d\udd17 The below example is for a \"large\" sized User Avatar on AWS: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www.guilded.gg/UserAvatar/{hash}-Large.png Upload a File \ud83d\udd17 POST https://media.guilded.gg/media/upload Returns {\"url\": \"https://a_url_to_your_uploaded_file.png\"} on success. Form Data \ud83d\udd17 Field Type Description file binary data the data of the file Query Args \ud83d\udd17 Field Type Description Required Accepted Values dynamicMediaTypeId string the type of media that you are uploading true a valid dynamic media type Dynamic Media Types \ud83d\udd17 Type Description CustomReaction custom server emoji ContentMedia attachment in chat UserAvatar user avatar UserBanner profile banner TeamAvatar team icon TeamBanner team banner GroupAvatar group icon Binary File Data \ud83d\udd17 This can probably be handled by your HTTP library/something built-in to your lang. Here are some code examples: Python # with aiohttp import aiohttp async def upload_file(path_to_file, media_type): file = open(path_to_file, 'rb') # or another bytes-like object async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session: response = await session.post( 'https://media.guilded.gg/media/upload', data={'file': file}, params={'dynamicMediaTypeId': media_type} ) data = await response.json() return data['url'] # with requests import requests def upload_file(path_to_file, media_type): file = open(path_to_file, 'rb') # or another bytes-like object response = requests.post( 'https://media.guilded.gg/media/upload', data={'file': file}, params={'dynamicMediaTypeId': media_type} ) data = response.json() return data['url']","title":"Reference"},{"location":"reference/#reference","text":"On a conceptual level, Discord and Guilded's APIs both function similarly.

Clients will receive events and data over the gateway they are connected to and send data over the REST API. The API for interacting with Gateways is complex and fairly unforgiving, therefore it's highly recommended you read all of the following documentation before writing a custom implementation. Payloads \ud83d\udd17 Gateway Payload Structure \ud83d\udd17 The only constant field you will receive is type - the event's name. Except when connecting, type will not be null ; it will simply not be included. The rest of the event's data is included top-level with the event payload (e.g. no data field which contains it all). For reference purposes, your typical Gateway payload will look something like this: { \"type\" : \"EventName\" , \"somethingId\" : \"ffd717d5-73f1-11eb-8d50-6245b4f631c5\" , \"listOfThings\" : [], \"stackedContentObject\" : { \"nodes\" : [{ \"leaves\" : [{ \"content\" : \"hey go write something funny for the docs\" }] }] }, \"happenedAt\" : \"ISO8601.T.ime:sta:mpZ\" , \"imageLink\" : \"https://the-entire-url.to-the-file-on.aws/because_lol-Large.webp\" , \"madeBy\" : \"5A2B60\" } Connecting to the Gateway \ud83d\udd17 It is important to note the Gateway's base URL here (which is different from the REST API's ): wss://api.guilded.gg Connecting \ud83d\udd17 Gateway URL Params \ud83d\udd17 Field Type Description Accepted Values jwt string authentication stuff? 'undefined' EIO integer Engine.IO version 3 transport string the type of transport 'websocket' guildedClientId string used for authentication the guilded_mid cookie received when logging in via REST ?teamId * string the team's socket to connect to a team ID * This is for team-specific events like member and channel updates. In order to receive a team's events, you will need to open a separate connection for it, which you should treat just like the main websocket - heartbeat and all. The first step in establishing connectivity to the gateway is to construct your gateway URL. Options are pretty limited, so you should end up with something like wss://api.guilded.gg/socket.io/?jwt=undefined&EIO=3&transport=websocket&guildedClientId={guilded_mid_header} (assuming you don't want to connect to a team websocket). You can now open a websocket connection to the URL you have created. Once connected, the client should immediately receive a \"hello\"-type payload , with information on the connection's heartbeat interval. Example Gateway Hello \ud83d\udd17 { \"sid\" : \"your_session_id\" , \"upgrades\" : [], \"pingInterval\" : 25000 , \"pingTimeout\" : 5000 } Heartbeating \ud83d\udd17 The client should now begin sending heartbeat payloads (the string '2') every pingInterval milliseconds, until the connection is eventually closed or terminated, from now until the end of time, or forever hold your peace. It is unknown whether Guilded will suddenly request you for a heartbeat, so documentation for this case is not available. Example Gateway Heartbeat ACK \ud83d\udd17 \"3\" Disconnections \ud83d\udd17 If the gateway ever issues a disconnect to your client, it will provide a close event code that you can use to properly handle the disconnection. A full list of these close codes can be found in the Response Codes documentation. When you close the connection to the gateway with the close code 1000 or 1001, your session will be invalidated and your bot will appear offline. If you simply close the TCP connection, or use a different close code, the bot session will remain active and timeout after a few minutes. This can be useful for a reconnect, which will resume the previous session. Todo verify that above applies Rate Limiting \ud83d\udd17 Info This section is about Gateway rate limits, not HTTP API rate limits . Currently unknown. See above. Commands and Events \ud83d\udd17 Commands are requests made by a client over the gateway.
